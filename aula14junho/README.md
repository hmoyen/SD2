# RISC-V Processor Development in Verilog

This Verilog project involves the creation of a RISC-V processor, integrating data flow and a state machine. The module encompasses various inputs and outputs, including clock, reset, opcode, ALU control signals, memory write enables, and register file write enables. It implements functionality for data and instruction memory access, ALU operations, register file operations, immediate generation, and control signals. Additionally, it employs various modules for components such as ALU, ALU control, register file, multiplexers, and PC.

## Project Components:

1.**UC**
2.**Dataflow**

## Functionality:
- The microcontroller processes instructions fetched from memory and executes them based on the opcode.
- Control signals are generated to enable memory and register file write operations.
- Data and instruction memory access, ALU operations, register file operations, and immediate generation are implemented.
- The project aims to simulate the behavior of a RISC-V processor using Verilog, integrating data flow and a state machine for efficient operation.
